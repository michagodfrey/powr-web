# POWR - Progressive Overload Workout Recorder

This is a work in progress. The development approach of using Cursor AI with thorough rules was inspired by [Coding from Beach](https://www.peregianhub.com.au/connect/technologists/).

## Rules and PRD

This project was built with carefully laid out rules and product requirement document (PRD) files in the docs and cursor folders.

The file docs/learnings.md is updated after changes and is a log of the development.
