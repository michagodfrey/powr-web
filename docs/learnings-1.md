### 2024-03-12: OAuth Callback URL Configuration Fix

**What Happened**:

- Identified and resolved Google OAuth callback URL mismatch error (400: redirect_uri_mismatch)
- Fixed environment configuration conflict in `.env` file
- Corrected `NODE_ENV` and `SERVER_URL` settings to be environment-specific
- Ensured proper callback URL registration in Google Cloud Console

**Technical Details**:

- Development callback URL: `http://localhost:4000/api/auth/google/callback`
- Production callback URL: `https://[your-domain]/api/auth/google/callback`
- Environment-specific configuration to prevent conflicts
- Proper error handling for OAuth callback failures

**Why It Matters**:

- Prevents authentication failures due to mismatched callback URLs
- Ensures proper separation between development and production environments
- Maintains security while allowing local development to function correctly
- Provides clear configuration pattern for future setups

**Next Steps**:

1. Add automated environment validation on server startup
2. Create development environment setup script
3. Document Google OAuth configuration steps in README
4. Add environment configuration checklist to PR template

### 2024-03-13: Authentication Initialization Order Refactor

**What Happened**:

- Refactored server initialization to ensure proper order of database, passport, and Express app setup
- Modified app initialization to use dependency injection for passport configuration
- Updated passport configuration to explicitly return configured instance
- Issue persists: 500 error on `/api/auth/me` endpoint still occurring

**Technical Details**:

- Changed `app.ts` to export `createApp` function that accepts configured passport instance
- Modified `index.ts` to properly sequence initialization:
  1. Database initialization
  2. Passport configuration
  3. Express app creation with configured passport
- Ensured session store is initialized before passport middleware

**Why It Matters**:

- Proper initialization order is crucial for session-based authentication
- Dependency injection pattern makes the initialization sequence explicit
- Helps prevent race conditions and initialization-related bugs

**Next Steps**:

1. Add detailed logging in error handler to capture exact cause of 500 error
2. Verify session store is properly initialized and accessible
3. Add middleware to log session and authentication state
4. Consider implementing health check endpoint to verify system state

### 2024-03-13: Session Store Schema Issue Identified

**What Happened**:

- Enhanced error logging revealed missing database schema for session storage
- Error: `column "sess" does not exist` when accessing `/api/auth/me`
- Issue occurs in `connect-pg-simple` session store initialization

**Technical Details**:

- Session store requires a specific table schema for storing session data
- Required columns include:
  - `sid` (primary key)
  - `sess` (JSON data)
  - `expire` (timestamp)
- Current database sync doesn't include session table schema

**Why It Matters**:

- Session storage is crucial for maintaining user authentication state
- Without proper session storage, authentication flow breaks
- Explains the 500 errors we've been seeing on authentication endpoints

**Next Steps**:

1. Create session table schema with required columns
2. Add SQL initialization script for session table
3. Ensure schema is created before session store initialization
4. Add schema validation on server startup

### 2024-03-13: Session Table Creation Fix

**What Happened**:

- Fixed session table creation error by separating table and index creation
- Error was caused by trying to create index before table creation was complete
- Modified database initialization to execute SQL statements sequentially

**Technical Details**:

- Split SQL into two separate statements:
  1. CREATE TABLE for sessions
  2. CREATE INDEX for expire column
- Removed external SQL file in favor of inline queries
- Added explicit logging for each step of initialization

**Why It Matters**:

- Ensures proper session table creation for authentication
- Prevents race conditions in database initialization
- Provides clearer error messages and initialization status

**Next Steps**:

1. Add database schema version tracking
2. Create database migration system
3. Add session table cleanup job
4. Monitor session storage performance

// Improved validation
const weightNum = typeof weight === "string" ? parseFloat(weight) : weight;
const repsNum = typeof reps === "string" ? parseInt(reps, 10) : reps;

     id: Date.now() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000);

     // Second attempt
     id: Date.now() * 1000 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);

     // Quick scheme approach
     const baseTimestamp = Date.now() * 1000;
     id: baseTimestamp + index;
     ```

   - Issue persists: editing one set still affects all sets in quick scheme workouts

**Technical Details**:

1. **Current Implementation**:

   - Using timestamp-based IDs with random offsets
   - Maintaining set order through `setNumber` property
   - Proper sorting implementation for consistent display
   - Type-safe handling of set properties

   - Quick scheme sets sharing same ID despite generation attempts
   - Possible race condition or state management issue
   - ID generation may not be as unique as expected

**Why It Matters**:

1. **User Experience**:

   - Critical bug affecting workout data integrity
   - Users unable to edit individual sets in quick schemes
   - Risk of unintended data modifications
   - Impacts core workout tracking functionality

2. **Technical Impact**:
   - Highlights potential React state management issues
   - Questions effectiveness of current ID generation approach
   - May indicate deeper architectural considerations
   - Important for maintaining data consistency

**Next Steps**:

1. **Investigation**:

   - Debug ID generation timing and uniqueness
   - Review React state updates in quick scheme application
   - Test alternative ID generation strategies
   - Consider using a more robust unique ID library

2. **Potential Solutions**:

   - Implement UUID or nanoid for guaranteed uniqueness
   - Review state management approach for quick schemes
   - Consider using React keys differently
   - Add explicit validation for ID uniqueness

3. **Future Considerations**:
