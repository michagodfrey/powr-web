# Project Overview

## Project Name

**Progressive Overload Workout Recorder (POWR)**

## Description

POWR is a minimalistic web and (eventually) mobile application designed to help users track **progressive overload** in compound exercises. Progressive overload is the principle of gradually increasing the weight, volume, or intensity of exercises to continually challenge muscles and promote ongoing strength gains.

Rather than a full workout tracker, POWR focuses on **monitoring weight volume trends** over time, enabling lifters to see clear evidence of their progress.

## Target Audience

- Strength training enthusiasts
- Powerlifters and bodybuilders focusing on progressive overload
- Users seeking a simple, data-driven approach to strength tracking

## Primary Goals

1. **Clean and Minimalistic UI**  
   Provide a distraction-free interface that makes data entry quick and intuitive.

2. **Volume Trend Monitoring**  
   Allow users to visualize and track their total volume lifted over time for specific exercises.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   Present progress through attractive and easy-to-understand graphs.

4. **Future Mobile Expansion**  
   Start as a web application with the potential to expand to Android/iOS later.

## Objectives

1. **MVP Validation**  
   Develop a core web-based MVP to validate essential features (exercise input, volume tracking, and graph visualization).
2. **Intuitive Data Entry**  
   Ensure minimal user friction by providing defaults, placeholders, and quick editing features.
3. **Scalability & Efficiency**  
   Use a robust backend and database to handle growth in users and data.
4. **User Satisfaction**  
   Gather feedback to refine the UI/UX and ensure it meets the needs of the target audience.

## Success Metrics

- **Data Accuracy**: Correct calculations of volume, sets, and reps for each workout session.
- **Performance**: Fast load times and responsive UI.
- **User Adoption**: Frequency of returning users and positive feedback on ease of use.
- **Visual Appeal**: High satisfaction ratings for chart clarity and design aesthetics.

## Development Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Web Application**

   - Focus on core web application development
   - Implement all essential features
   - Ensure stability and performance
   - Validate user experience and gather feedback

2. **Phase 2: Mobile Application**
   - Begin mobile development after web app is stable and fully functional
   - Follow mobile-roadmap.md for detailed implementation steps
   - Leverage existing backend infrastructure
   - Focus on native mobile experience

Note: Mobile development will commence only after the web application is working as expected and has been validated with users.
