- This approach keeps the experience streamlined and focused.
- **Brutalist Touch:**  
  The modal should feature minimalistic design elements and strong, raw borders.

### Smart Data Input

- Use clean, large input fields with clear labels (e.g., "Weight", "Reps", "Sets").
- Incorporate placeholder text that hints at previous values to speed up data entry.
- Integrate a "duplicate set" button (as a small, easily accessible icon) next to each set field to quickly replicate common schemes (like 3x12 or 5x5).
- **Brutalist Touch:**  
  Use bold typography and raw, minimal input designs that emphasize functionality over embellishment.

### Minimal Distractions

- Implement subtle animations, such as a gentle fade-in effect, to maintain focus and ensure a smooth user experience.

  Use stark, solid lines and unembellished toggle buttons that align with the overall brutalist theme.
