# Implementation

## Development Milestones

1. **Planning & Wireframing**
   - Finalize UI wireframes based on the minimalistic design principle.
   - Confirm core data structures (exercises, sets, reps, volume calculation).

2. **Core Features**
   - Implement exercise creation, editing, and deletion.
   - Build the data entry form for sets/reps/weights with duplication functionality.
   - Set up backend routes for storing and retrieving workout data.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Integrate charting library (Chart.js or Recharts) to display volume trends.
   - Provide multiple date range filters (weekly, monthly, custom).

4. **Testing & Feedback**
   - Conduct thorough testing (unit tests, integration tests).
   - Gather user feedback on UI/UX, performance, and any bugs.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the MVP web app (e.g., on Vercel).
   - Ensure the backend (Node.js/Express) and database (PostgreSQL) are configured in a production environment.

## Key Implementation Details

- **Architecture**: A RESTful API (Node/Express) for data storage and retrieval, with a React frontend.
- **Database Schema**:
  - `Users` table (for user authentication and settings).
  - `Exercises` table (exercise metadata).
  - `Workouts` or `Sets` table (tracking date, weight, reps, sets, volume).
- **Security**:
  - Use HTTPS for all network communication.
  - Implement basic authentication or OAuth for user login (depending on scope).
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Optimize queries for quick data retrieval.
  - Cache static content where possible.
