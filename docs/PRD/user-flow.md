# User Flow

1. **Landing / Home Page**
   - The user is introduced to POWR's core concept: tracking progressive overload.
   - Clear call-to-action (CTA) to either log in or sign up.

2. **Dashboard / Exercise List**
   - After logging in, the user sees a list of exercises (e.g., deadlift, bench press, squat).
   - The user can select an exercise to view historical data or add a new exercise.

3. **Workout Data Entry**
   - On selecting an exercise, the user enters weight, reps, and sets for the session.
   - Options to duplicate set/rep schemes (e.g., 3x12, 5x5) and adjust as needed.
   - The app automatically calculates total volume.

4. **Progress Visualization**
   - The user navigates to a dedicated chart page (or section) showing trends (weekly, monthly, custom range).
   - Charts update dynamically as new data is added.

5. **Settings & Preferences**
   - The user can switch between kg and lb, enable dark mode, or manage account details.
   - Option to export data (CSV/PDF) from the settings or dashboard.

6. **Future Mobile Sync**
   - In later versions, the user can install the mobile app.
   - Any data entered on web automatically syncs to mobile (and vice versa).
