# Tech Stack

## Frontend

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and large ecosystem.
- **Charting Library**: Either **Chart.js** or **Recharts** for creating interactive data visualizations.
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS (Styled Components) or a modern CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind, Material UI).

## Backend

- **Node.js** & **Express.js**: For building a RESTful API that handles workout data, user authentication, etc.

## Database

- **PostgreSQL**: A reliable relational database well-suited for structured data.  
  - Alternatively, MySQL could also be used, but PostgreSQL is often preferred for advanced features.

## Hosting & Deployment

- **Vercel** (or Netlify) for deploying the frontend.
- **Heroku** (or AWS/GCP) for hosting the Node.js/Express backend and PostgreSQL database.
  - Alternatively, use **Railway.app** or **Render.com** for a quick, integrated solution.

## Future Mobile Expansion

- **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile apps sharing similar logic and components with the React web app.
- Potential integration with wearable APIs (Apple HealthKit, Google Fit) for advanced features in later phases.
