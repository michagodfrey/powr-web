   - Applied to charts and workout history

**Why It Matters**:

- Improves user experience with persistent settings
- Provides consistent unit display across the app
- Supports accessibility with dark mode
- Maintains user preferences across sessions
- Follows system preferences by default

**Next Steps**:

1. Theme Improvements:

   - Review system theme override behavior - currently system theme takes precedence over user preference
   - Consider adding option to "Always use system theme" vs. "Use custom preference"
   - Add visual indicator when system theme is overriding user preference

2. Unit System Enhancements:

   - Implement proper unit conversion for historical workout data display
   - Add unit conversion for total volume display to match selected preference
   - Consider storing both kg/lb values at time of entry for accurate historical records
   - Add warning when changing units about historical data display
   - Consider adding unit conversion utilities for consistent calculations

3. Additional Features:
   - Date format preferences
   - Time zone settings
   - Default workout templates
   - Chart display options

**Challenges & Solutions**:

- **Challenge**: System theme override

  - **Current Behavior**: System theme takes precedence over user preference
  - **Potential Solution**: Add explicit control over theme source (system vs. user preference)

- **Challenge**: Unit conversion consistency

  - **Current Issue**: Historical workout data and volume calculations don't update with unit preference
  - **Potential Solution**: Implement real-time conversion for display while maintaining original units in storage

- **Challenge**: Historical data integrity
  - **Current Issue**: Changing units affects how historical data is interpreted
  - **Potential Solution**: Store both kg/lb values at entry time for accurate historical records

**PRD Alignment**:

- ✅ User preference persistence
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Unit system flexibility
- ⚠️ Need to improve unit conversion consistency
- ⚠️ Need to clarify theme override behavior
